I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Texas Tech University, where my research focused on the intersection of **security, performance, and scalability** in modern systems.

Key areas:
- **Secure memory architectures:** Capability-based global address spaces (xBGAS) on CHERI/ARM Morello.
- **GPU efficiency:** DVFS-aware power and performance modeling across NVIDIA and AMD GPUs.
- **System side channels:** GPU-based covert and side-channel analysis in shared environments.
